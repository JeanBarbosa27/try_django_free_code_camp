# Try Django with Free Code Camp
This project was created to follow the getting started in Django youtube video, for studing pruposes with Free Code Camp methods.

## Project dependencies
To get dependencies intallations easy, it was used the pipenv, despite in the video it was used another virtual environment creation way, I had some problems when I tried to interact with models by the admin, due to it I choose to do this way with a newer Python and Django versions, in which the problem doesn't happend. Therefore, ensure that you have `pipenv` install in your machine and, before everything, install all project dependencies with the following command line `pipenv install`.

## Run locally
Everytime you need to run it locally, remember to activate the virtual environment with the following command line `pipenv shell` and then, considering that you are at the same directory of `manage.py` file, run the command line `python manage.py runserver` or if you prefer, just type `./manage.py runserver`.
